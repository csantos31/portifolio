**The purpose of this project**

I've been a developer since 2017, I have my GitHub with a few projects but with this portfolio, I can show a little of my identity.

As you can notice, I am not a designer, but I used FIGMA to create a template for this project, the link for Figma template can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/95sbqPe2t1avhMr8xfS3oy/my.portifolio?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=3PxUROn6fi9OE60c-1)

Also, I decided to create this using no framework, so it can be simpler, and lighter. 

**My favorite technologies**

I am more familiar with backend environments, I've been developing for mobile for two years using Java and Kotlin, also, I've been developing for web using CSharp with .net for a time.

Also have experience in PHP, node.js, and others.

Since last year (2022) I am on a position focused on frontend, using ReactJS. So, I feel comfortable with frontend  and backend development, and personally, I like fullstack positions more than just one of them. 

**OPEN TO A NEW JOB**

Some more consideration is that I am open to new positions, I can communicate in Portuguese (native), English (fluent), and Spanish (intermediate)
